## Introduction
The fingerPrinterProject_ICE48D is a software application designed to manage user identities and associated fingerprint data. It allows users to enroll their fingerprints. When a new user is added, we get the code number from the fingerprinter to our system. So we can add other details of the user from our system to that code number.
Every time a student whose data is added to the system Place finger on the fingerprint scanner it shows the following details.
        1. **Name**
        2. **Index**
        3. **Index**
